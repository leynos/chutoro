//! HNSW insertion workflow.
//!
//! Provides the planning and application phases for inserting nodes into the HNSW
//! graph. Planning computes the descent path and layer-by-layer neighbour
//! candidates without holding write locks. Application mutates the graph
//! structure, performs bidirectional linking, and schedules trimming jobs for
//! nodes that exceed maximum connection limits.

/// Extracts candidate edges from an insertion plan.
///
/// Collects all neighbour relationships discovered during planning as directed
/// edges from the inserted node to each discovered neighbour. Captures edges
/// from all layers to ensure comprehensive MST candidate coverage.
///
/// Self-edges (where `source == target`) are filtered out.
///
/// # Duplicate Edges
///
/// The same neighbour may appear in multiple layers of the insertion plan,
/// resulting in duplicate `(source, target, distance)` tuples with identical
/// sequence numbers. This is intentional behaviour:
///
/// - The downstream MST pipeline treats edges as a simple graph; duplicates
///   are naturally deduplicated when building the union-find structure.
/// - Preserving duplicates here avoids an O(n log n) sort + dedup per insertion
///   in the hot path, deferring any deduplication cost to the final MST phase.
/// - The edge count may exceed the number of unique node pairs, but this does
///   not affect correctness.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `source_node` - The node being inserted
/// * `source_sequence` - Insertion sequence for deterministic tie-breaking
/// * `plan` - The insertion plan containing discovered neighbours per layer
///
/// # Examples
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use crate::hnsw::insert::extract_candidate_edges;
/// use crate::hnsw::types::InsertionPlan;
///
/// let plan = /* ... */;
/// let edges = extract_candidate_edges(5, 42, &plan);
/// assert!(edges.iter().all(|e| e.source() == 5));
