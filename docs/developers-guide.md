# Developers guide

This guide collects day-to-day practices for contributors working on the
Chutoro codebase. It complements the more specialized documents in `docs/` and
keeps operational guidance in one place.

## Benchmarks

The `chutoro-benches` crate provides Criterion benchmarks for the four CPU
pipeline stages: Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) index construction,
edge harvest, minimum spanning tree (MST) computation, and hierarchy extraction.

### Running benchmarks

Run all benchmarks from the repository root:

```sh
make bench
```

Criterion writes HTML reports to `target/criterion/`. Open the report for a
specific group (for example `target/criterion/hnsw_build/report/index.html`) to
view timing distributions and comparisons against previous runs.

### Benchmark architecture

Benchmarks live in `chutoro-benches/benches/` as separate Criterion binaries.
Shared support code — the `SyntheticSource` data source, benchmark parameter
types, and the `BenchSetupError` error type — lives in the `chutoro-benches`
library (`chutoro-benches/src/`).

Each benchmark file follows this pattern:

1. A fallible `_impl` function performs all setup (data generation, HNSW
   build, MST computation) using `?` to propagate errors via `BenchSetupError`.
2. A thin wrapper registered with `criterion_group!` calls the `_impl`
   function and panics on failure.
3. The measured closure uses `b.iter()` or `b.iter_batched()` to time only
   the target operation.

### Lint policy for benchmarks

The `chutoro-benches` crate does **not** inherit workspace lints. Criterion's
macro expansions (`criterion_group!`, `criterion_main!`, `bench_with_input`
closures) trigger several of the strict workspace denials — most notably
`missing_docs`, `shadow_reuse`, and `excessive_nesting`. A crate-local
`[lints]` section in `chutoro-benches/Cargo.toml` mirrors the workspace
strictness for handwritten code. Benchmark source files use tightly scoped
`#![expect(lint, reason = "…")]` attributes for the lints that Criterion's
macro expansions unavoidably trigger. The rationale is documented in a comment
at the top of the `[lints.clippy]` section in `chutoro-benches/Cargo.toml`.

### Adding a new benchmark

1. Create a new file in `chutoro-benches/benches/`.
2. Add a corresponding `[[bench]]` entry in `chutoro-benches/Cargo.toml`.
3. Follow the fallible-setup pattern described above.
4. Use `#![expect(…)]` (not `#![allow(…)]`) for any Criterion-triggered lint
   suppressions, with a reason string.
5. Run `make bench` to verify the new benchmark appears in the output.

## Verus proofs

Verus is used for formal verification of edge harvest primitives. Run proofs
via `make verus`, which is idempotent and installs the pinned Verus release and
required Rust toolchain as needed.

### Quantifier trigger annotations

Verus prints warnings when it selects quantifier triggers automatically. Do not
ignore these warnings. Prefer explicit annotations so the prover behaviour is
stable and predictable:

- Use `#[trigger]` when a specific term should control instantiation.
- Use `#![auto]` only when the automatically chosen trigger is acceptable and
  the quantifier is straightforward.
- Avoid `--triggers-mode silent` in continuous integration (CI) because it
  hides trigger-selection changes.

Example:

```rust
assert forall|i: int| #![auto] 0 <= i < edges.len() implies edges[i].source == source_node;
```
